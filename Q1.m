% (1) You are given a dataset with 1000 data points each in R2 . % (a)
% Write a piece of code to run the PCA algorithm on this data-set. How much
% of % the variance in the data-set is explained by each of the principal
% components? % (b) Write a piece of code to implement the Kernel PCA
% algorithm on this dataset. % Explore various kernels discussed in class.
% For each Kernel, plot the projection % of each point in the dataset onto
% the top-2 principal components. Use one plot % for each kernel - In case
% of RBF kernel, use a different plot for each value of Ïƒ % that you use. %
% (c) Which Kernel do you think is best suited for this dataset and why?
